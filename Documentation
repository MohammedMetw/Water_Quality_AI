1. Data Understanding & Exploration
•	Data Overview
•	Data Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics for each feature.
•	 Data Visualization:  Visualizations to understand feature distributions and relationships.
•	 Class Distribution Check: Analysis of class balance and identification of any imbalances.
•	Correlation Analysis: Identification of correlations between features and the target variable.






2. Data Preprocessing
•	Missing Data Handling: Handling of missing values through imputation by mean.
•	Feature Scaling/Normalization: Scaling techniques are used to ensure all features are on a comparable scale.
•	Outlier Detection and Treatment: handling of outliers by Z-Score.
•	Feature Engineering: Creation or modification of features to enhance model performance.







3. Model Building
•	Model Selection: trying Some models and choose the best of them.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model hyperparameters.
•	Cross-Validation: Implementation of cross-validation to ensure model generalization.
•	Baseline Model Comparison: Comparison of selected model with a baseline model to measure improvement.







4. Model Evaluation
•	Confusion Matrix Analysis: Evaluation of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.
•	Performance Metrics Calculation: Calculation of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and other relevant metrics.
•	Class Imbalance Handling: Techniques used to address class imbalance by over sampler.
•	Threshold Tuning: Adjustment of classification threshold to improve metric balance.







5. Reproducibility
•	Code Quality: Ensuring code is well-organized, commented, and follows best practices.
•	Reproducibility: Provision of necessary scripts, environments, and datasets to reproduce results.
